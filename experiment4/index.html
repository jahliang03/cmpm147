      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        For this experiment, I created three generative worlds. 
        
        The first is a flower field inspired by Hitachi Seaside Park. 
        The project uses word-based seeds to generate different landscapes, filled with clusters of flowers 
        scattered across a stylized, scrolling environment. Players can explore the world with the arrow keys, 
        and clicking plants a new flower wherever they click. A bee cursor follows the player’s mouse movement to helpe
        pollinate the blue tiles that represent flowers. 

        For my lotus pond world the format of the scroll is the same but the scene features procedurally placed lotus flowers, lilypads, 
        and subtle water ripples with the square tiles, evoking the calmness of a natural pond. The color palette emphasizes soft pastels and 
        gentle movement to enhance the relaxing atmosphere. It also makes use of the bee cursor to help grow the lotus leaves. The world makes use of different shapes 
        and customized flowers. 

        The earthland world plays around with different terrain. The tree can only be planted where there's land and soil. It can't be planted in water. It plays around with terrain 
        and the ellipses shape was used to generate the plots of terrain.

      <h2>Technical</h2>
      <p>
        The flower world uses Perlin noise to determine where flowers are placed across a large grid-based landscape.Flowers and ground circles are layered using simple ellipse 
        shapes to recreate the shapes of the flower field. Clicking on the world plants a new flower at the clicked location, and a custom bee cursor follows the player’s mouse 
        for an extra fun touch. 

        The lotus pond is built using noise-based placement algorithms, creating organic, clustered patterns for lilypads and flowers. 
        Ripples are simulated through animated Perlin noise, and layered transparency effects create depth on the water's surface. 
        The environment refreshes procedurally each time a new seed is entered.

        Terrain is generated using Perlin noise, assigning elevation-based biomes like water, grassland, forest, and hills. 
        Soft-edged elliptical tiles convey organic terrain, and tree planting is tracked in a map keyed by tile coordinates. 
        Trees appear with layered triangles for a stylized pine effect, and interaction is limited to valid terrain zones.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        For this set of experiments, I created three different procedural worlds, each replicating nature in some form. The lotus pond world focuses on subtle motion and peaceful atmosphere, 
        with lilypads and flowers gently scattered across a rippling pond. Earthland generates a large-scale natural environment with terrain types like grassland, forests, hills, and mountains, 
        allowing players to plant trees and gradually shape the world. The Hitachi Seaside Park project brings a colorful flower field to life, using scrolling camera movement, a playful bee cursor, 
        and interactive flower planting based on word-seeded generation. Together, these worlds show how procedural systems can create living, responsive environments through different types of noise, 
        tile rendering, and player interaction. Playing around with the three worlds definitely gave me a better understanding of shapes within the P5 library and how these projections can be angled
        and altered to create an open world. The base of the code I used was rather simple so I didn't have much trouble altering it to work for each differnt iteration. The most issue's I had was 
        simply readjusting the code to work in the sketch.js environment.
