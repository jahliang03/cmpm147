      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
       For this assignment I chose three images to process into the generator. These are all images I taken around Santa Cruz and Monteray recently. I wanted to make
       each image reminisent of impressionistic paintings. I specifically chose images with round shapes and vibrant colors to see how they would translate through the 
       the generator with the altered values. I kept the shapes relatively simple as I wanted the main focus to be the orginal colors and shape of the image. Even at 
       100% mutation, I wanted the images to still be able to resemble the orginal photos.

      <h2>Technical</h2>
      <p>
        This experiment uses an evolutionary algorithm to gradually generate abstract art derived from a reference image. It initializes a grid of semi-transparent ellipses, 
        each sampling color from the source image, and mutates their position, size, and color over time based on a user-controlled mutation rate. Fitness is calculated by comparing 
        the rendered canvas to the original imageâ€™s pixel data, guiding the evolution toward visual similarity.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I know we were told to focus on adding color but in order to get the look I wanted to achieve with this experiment, I implemented a color picker. I also wanted to 
        keep the shapes relatively simple so that I can get the painterly feel I was hoping to get with the experiment. Overall coding this was really fun for me 
        and the image mutation with time and user setting was a really cool addition to play around with. I will definitely be reusing the source code for this project for 
        a lot of the other photos I take later on.
